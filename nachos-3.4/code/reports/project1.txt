Exercise I. Simple Threads Programming (Analyze and explain results)

	 After making the changes appropriate changes in "threadtest.cc" and
	 "main.cc" we were able to execute the newly created thread test in
	 Nachos. The test was run with 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 as the argument for
	 the function ThreadTest(). The results were as follows:

	  1. Argument 0:   No threads ready or runnable the machine halts.
          2. Argument 1-4: 1-5 (dependent on the argument) threads run.
	     	      	   as 1-4 are forked and the original runs the
			   function as well. All of these arguments
			   resulted in a final value of 5.

          After this the Semaphores were intoduced into the code as
          directed by the instructions. Resulting in syncrhonized results.


Exercise Status

Exercise I.
	 Complete with proper synchronization for the final part
	 which still holds when the -rs flag is set (tested with
	 several seeds).

Exercise II.
	 Complete with proper Lock synchronization that still holds
	 when the -rs flag is set (tested with several seeds).

Exercise III.
	 Completed, tested and verified in the SimpleThread function
	 with the -rs flag and several seeds (tests removed as they
	 were not specifed by the instructions).

Exercise IV.
	 Completed, tested and verified with the -rs flag with several
	 seeds, varying passernger amounts (above and below max capacity),
	 varying floors and with random generation of threads.
